NokiaPhonebookTask

Write a class in C++ or Java language that meets the following requirements.

- It is a phonebook. It should contain phone numbers and subscribers. 
    For any subscriber, one or more phone numbers can be assigned. 
    For any phone number exactly one subscriber can be assigned.
- Provide a search by phone number function which returns a string 
    or throws an exception if there is no match.
- Provide a search by subscriber function which returns a list 
    of phone numbers.
- Make both searches as efficient as possible.
- The internal representation is up to you, but do NOT use any advanced 
    data structures provided by the language or frameworks. 
    Arrays, enums, classes, records, pointers can be used, 
    but Vectors, Lists, Maps, etc. are not allowed.
- Provide a function that expects two parameters (name and phone number)
    and adds these to your phonebook as a pair. 
    It should throw an exception when the exact same record is already 
    in the phonebook, or if the input is malformed.
- Provide another function with these parameters. 
    These function will delete the given record from the phonebook. 
    If no such entry, throw an exception.
- Subscriber's name could be anything. 
- Accepted phone number format should be configurable 
    externally (e.g. as a command line argument). 
    Use regular expressions for phone number validation.
- Create a command line app or a unit test set to present the features of your class.
- Write a short documentation about the functions and the usage of the application/classes.

Write clean, well-organized, self documenting code.
